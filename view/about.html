<p>IPSEM LOREM I'd rather be an outsider. (1409607566242). Cause I'm tired of trying to get over them. My whole life changed (that's when). I won't stay here another night. Ya'll don't quite understand the story I got. My whole life changed (that day). Bookstore pimpin' them hope books, like God don't know how broke looks. You ain't got game, ya doin ya own thang. My game on 8 ball corner pocket. I'll see you on the other side. I once popped a whole thing of pills in hopes that I drop. My whole life changed (that's when). But, I'd rather go where my fist high. Pastor manipulatin' hurtin' women, I wonder what he's gon' say next</p>

That truth is tatted up on my heart and can't nobody get that ink up out it. You can feel the rhythm when you listen to the rhyme. My cousin walked out a party, bow, got shot.
